- Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool.

Struture:
  - UI/CLI -> API: API to access the master node
    - Master Node: The server that manages the worker nodes
      - Worker Node: These servers run the applications and services
        - Pod: A group of containers that share storage/networking, and specifications on how to run the containers
        - Supervisord
        - Docker
        - Kubelet
        - Kube-Proxy
        - Fluentd




- Pods: (Pods are a group of one or more containers (Dockers containers for example))
  - Containers within a pod share an IP address and port space and can find eachother on localhost.
  - Containers can also communicate using IPC (SysV semaphores, POSIX shared mem).
  - Containers in different pods have distinct IP addresses and can't communicate with IPC without special configuration.
  - Containers from different pods usually communicate with eachother using the IP addresses of each pod
  - Applications in a pod have access to shared volumes, which are part of the pod and can be mounted by each app.
  - In Docker terms, a pod is modelled like a group of Doker containers with shared namespaces and shared FS volumes.
  
  - Pod Example:
    - A pod with two containers, one container pulls files and stores them on a shared volume between the two containers.
      The other container in the pod is a web server that serves up the files from the shared volume.

- Why not just run multiple apps within one docker?
  - Transparency! Making the containers within the pod visible to infrastructure enable the ability to provide services to those
    containers such as process management and resource monitoring.
